    <h1>The beginning</h1>
    <p>
      I was taking the train one day afetr a long day of school when suddenly the train stopped and now usually theres always delays 
      on the train but thats when I realized that I was suddenly on the E train. In NY the E train travels on the express line to Queens from Manhattan.
      Before I come out the station I see homeless people hanging out and arguing for some space to chill. Before I look up i see a building with a lot of ads,
      Queens Center Mall is filled with many stores that I love.
